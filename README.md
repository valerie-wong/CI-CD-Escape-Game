# 🎮 CI/CD Escape Room

Welcome to the DevOps Escape Room!

You will progress through a series of levels, each represented by a Git branch.
Every level contains **one broken piece of CI/CD, testing, or infrastructure**.

Your goal for each level:
1. Checkout the branch for that level  
2. Fix the issue  
3. Push your change  
4. Wait for GitHub Actions to turn 🟢 GREEN  
5. Tell a facilitator to unlock the next level  

## Levels
- `level-1-yaml-broken`
- `level-2-tests-failing`
- `level-3-merge-conflict`
- `level-4-api-bug`
- `level-5-missing-secret`
- `level-6-prod-rollback`

## Rules
- You may NOT switch branches to look for “the answer.”  
- Solve each level *in the branch you’re on*.  
- Work as a team. Move fast. Break things. Fix them.

Good luck. 🧩🚀
